		<h2>DC Startup, POPVOX, to Showcase Online Advocacy Platform at SxSW</h2>

		<p><span class="dateline">March 9, 2011, Washington, DC ―</span> POPVOX, Inc., a Silicon Valley and DC startup designed by Washington insiders, was selected as one of eight ﬁnalists in the Social Media category for Microsoft BizSpark Accelerator at SXSW, where early stage technology companies demo innovative new technology in front of inﬂuential industry judges and a live audience.</p>

		<p>The three-day event will be held Monday, March 14th - Wednesday, March 16th. Judges will select a winner in each category to be revealed on March 15th at 6pm. POPVOX will present alongside seven other companies in the Social Media category at 12:30 on March 14th.</p>

		<p>"We are living in an era of unprecedented civic engagement empowered and ampliﬁed by technology," said POPVOX CEO and former Congressional staﬀer, Marci Harris. "Existing platforms like Facebook and Twitter have proven great for political organizing but lacking when it comes to aﬀecting policy."</p>

        <p>Rachna Choudhry, POPVOX co-founder and a former nonproﬁt lobbyist explained, "The POPVOX team understands Congress. We know what works and we designed a system to produce eﬀective advocacy for any size organization -- and for individual citizens who are moved to contact Congress on issues that matter to them."</p>

        <p>Built by GovTrack.us creator and POPVOX co-founder and CTO, Josh Tauberer, POPVOX provides citizens with a free platform for communication with Congress, channeling input to actual pending bills. Users take action to support or oppose, leave a personal message to Congress, and share their comment via social networks or email. Messages are delivered electronically to Capitol Hill and remain public on POPVOX in Bill Reports, with charts and maps of support, organization statements of support or opposition, sortable by state or Congressional district.</p>

        <p>Founding Advisor and ﬁnancial backer Tim O'Reilly says, "POPVOX brings a unique blend of Capitol Hill savvy and Silicon Valley technology to the problem of measuring and managing advocacy. You can think of it as a kind of Google Analytics service for politics, bringing visibility and actionable insight to both Congressional staﬀers and advocacy organizations."</p>
