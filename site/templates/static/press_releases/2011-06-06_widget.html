		<p><span class="dateline">June 6, 2011, NEW YORK ―</span> POPVOX, Inc., an award-winning Silicon Valley and Washington, DC-based startup today announced a free “Write Congress Widget,” which allows any website to let visitors weigh in on bills pending before the U.S. Congress using the powerful POPVOX platform.  CEO, Marci Harris, announced the free tool ― the first of its kind ― at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York, which explores and analyzes technology's impact on politics and government.</p>

		<p>“Citizen organizing through social media is bringing revolutionary change around the world,” said Harris, a former Congressional staffer.  “Grassroots tools for outreach to the US Congress have not kept pace  Until now, costs were high and the user experience was less than optimal.  The POPVOX Write Congress Widget changes that.  Anyone with a website ― from a national interest group to a local blog ― can now effectively get their users’ message to Congress in a targeted, effective way.”</p>

		<p>The free “Write Congress” widget embeds the powerful POPVOX advocacy tool onto any website. Visitors weigh in on a featured bill and POPVOX takes care of the rest. Constituent information is verified; messages are counted and aggregated on POPVOX.com and messages are delivered to the appropriate Members of Congress, with delivery confirmation.</p>
