        <h2>Takes First Prize in the Social Media Category</h2>

		<p><span class="dateline">March 17, 2011, Austin, TX ―</span> POPVOX, Inc., a Silicon Valley and Washington, DC-based startup providing a neutral, nonpartisan, public platform for advocacy and legislative information, was named the winner in the Social Media category at the Microsoft BizSpark Accelerator at South by Southwest (SxSW) Interactive 2011.</p>

		<p>Of more than 400 applicants, 32 semi-ﬁnalists in four categories were invited to Austin for a chance to demo their product in the two-day competition. The Accelerator culminated in a ﬁnal round of 5-minute pitches, in which 12 early stage companies showcased their companies in front of inﬂuential industry judges and a live audience. Judges for the ﬁnal round were Alfred Lin, Sequoia Capital; Paul Buchheit, YCombinator; and Mark Hinsbo, Vice President of Microsoft.</p>

		<p>The SxSW stage is renown as the launching pad for revolutionary companies like Twitter and FourSquare. We were overjoyed just to be invited to present alongside the innovative companies and accomplished entrepreneurs in this year s ﬁnals, said Marci Harris, POPVOX CEO. The judges recognition of POPVOX sends a message that the startup world is ready for ﬁrst-time, nontraditional founding teams with deep understanding of real-world problems. That s good news for thousands of new entrepreneurs across the country trying to break though.</p>

        <p>Harris, a former Congressional staﬀer, joined former lobbyist Rachna Choudhry and Josh Tauberer, creator of the award-winning GovTrack.us to build a free, nonpartisan platform for communication with Congress, channeling public input to pending bills. Users take action to support or oppose speciﬁc bills, send a personal message to Congress, and share their comment with others via social networks or email. Messages are delivered electronically to Capitol Hill and remain public on POPVOX in Bill Reports, with charts and maps assessing support as well as organization position statements, all sortable by state or Congressional district.</p>

        <p>POPVOX just launched this week a campaign to crowdfund the development of an iPad app dashboard for Congress and government aﬀairs professionals through appbackr.com's social publishing platform. <a href="http://www.appbacker.com/apps/POPVOX/popvox-for-mobile">http://www.appbacker.com/apps/POPVOX/popvox-for-mobile</a>.</p>
