		<h3 class="no_rule">Guidelines on Acceptable Language</h3>
		
		<p>POPVOX is a soapbox to quantify and amplify your voice on matters before the U.S. Congress. That said, it is not a forum for general political discussion and we encourage the use of a civil tone. While we hope we will not have to interfere with comments posted on the website, the following is a summary of our policy on acceptable language:</p>
		
		<p>Your comments here must pertain to legislation and must:</p>

		<ul class="bullets">
		<li>not be profane, harassing, or threatening to others</li>
		<li>not create a risk of harm to anyone</li>
		<li>not include the personal, private information of others</li>
		<li>not contain information that would be illegal for you to distribute</li>
		<li>not otherwise violate the rights of others</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If a comment does not satisfy these standards, we will remove the comment from the legislative reports that other users see, and we will notify the commenter of our decision.  The comment will continue to be counted toward the aggregate public sentiment statistics on POPVOX, and we will deliver the message to Congress provided it would not be unlawful for us to do so.  If the user chooses to revise the comment so that it satisfies these standards, then the comment will be displayed.  POPVOX reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether or not a comment satisfies the standards.</p>
		
		<p>Note that this is a summary of our content terms. Our <a href="#termsofuse">Terms of Use Agreement</a> sets out the standards in full.</p>
		<div class="clear"> </div>

	<div class="tab_privacyreport">
		<h3 class="no_rule">Privacy Report</h3>
		
		<p>How do you know that POPVOX takes your privacy seriously? It&rsquo;s not because we have a privacy policy. It&rsquo;s because we go the extra mile to show you as honestly and transparently as possible what we do with the personal information you give us.</p>

		<h3 class="no_rule">Privacy Policy</h3>
	   
<div class="commentary">A privacy policy is an important foundation of our relationship, but we do believe trust is earned. Read on for more commentary like this in the margins.</div>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on June 6, 2011. A history of changes to the privacy policy is given at the end.</p>
<p>Popvox, Inc. (“Popvox,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Popvox when you use the Popvox Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information.   We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="#termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> (see the corresponding tab on this page).</p>  
<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<div class="commentary">See our <a href="#privacyreport">Privacy Report</a> for details.</div>
<p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong>  You provide us information about yourself, such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address if you register for an account with the Service. You may also provide us with your public comments on issues, messages to Members of Congress, and messages to other users of the website. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  We may retain any such User-Provided Information indefinitely, except as noted below.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong>  Cookies are small text files that websites store on users’ computers that are used to keep track of who is who, in the same manner that one draws a ticket number at a market or DMV to hold a place in line. Each time you return to a website, your web browser sends back the cookie (i.e. your ticket number) given to you by that website. At Popvox as elsewhere, cookies help you log in faster and enable easier navigation through the site. Popvox uses persistent cookies, meaning they remain indefinitely on users’ computers until the user logs out of their Popvox account or instructs their web browser to clear any saved cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information:</strong>  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,  pages viewed, and other such information. We retain Log File Information for at most one year, after which point we will retain only aggregate statistics based on the Log File Information such as but not limited to site-wide monthly visit totals.</p>
<div class="commentary">You might notice we removed the part about &ldquo;non-obvious pingbacks&rdquo;. After some feedback on it, we decided we wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</div>
<p><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> On your visit to Popvox your web browser may access resources from third-party services that we have engaged with, including analytics services which help us understand how our users are using the website and advertising services which deliver advertising directly to the user. These services may collect the same sorts of information as described above and their use of it is governed by their Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>  
<div class="commentary">We&rsquo;re going to email you from time to time if you let us. You can <a href="/accounts/profile">change your email settings here</a>.</div>
<p>By providing Popvox your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings.  We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account settings page. You may not opt out of some Service-related e-mails except by closing your Popvox account.</p> 
<div class="commentary">We delete as much as we can when you ask us to delete your account. But we need to keep some records for a period of time for everyone&rsquo;s protection. If you wrote your Member of Congress, we keep records of what we&rsquo;ve sent on your behalf so no one can claim otherwise.</div>
<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, Popvox may retain your User-Provided Information for a commercially reasonable time as part of our backup and audit procedures.  Furthermore, Popvox may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member account.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation.  Popvox stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at {% obfuscated_email "privacy@popvox.com" %}.</p>
<p>We use cookies, non-obvious pingbacks, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) and track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

<h4>How We Share Your Information</h4>
<div class="commentary">POPVOX is a lockbox. Your personal information stays with us and your Members of Congress.</div>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  Popvox may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you.  If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Popvox (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Popvox will not share, rent, or sell your personally identifiable information in any other manner except as stated when you enter the information, or if you opt-in to additional services. For instance, it is noted on the website that Popvox may allow Congressional staff to access your name and physical address if you reside in their Congressional district. Members of Congress are greatly restricted in what they can do with this information by Congressional rules and law. If you use Popvox to comment on legislation before Congress, your comment along with your username and the city and state of your address, as you provided, will be displayed publicly. </h4>
<div class="commentary">This is mainly just if POPVOX gets acquired by another company, and obviously in that case they will have all of the information we have.</div>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>    
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (“Events”) on the Service together with a third party partner.  If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties’ use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Popvox will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Popvox, our Users or others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for Popvox services.</p>
<div class="commentary">We are leaving the possibility open of using a third-party ad service, although right now we run our advertising entirely in-house.</div>
<p>Popvox may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Popvox. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens and may also use other technologies such as cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  Popvox does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Popvox to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  In addition, third-party advertisers may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you, such as the addresses of the pages you visit. <!--If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here [link to policy and opt-out for relevant advertiser, e.g. http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html for Google or http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp for a number of advertisers including Google].-->  The Popvox Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.  Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p> 

<h4>How We Protect Your Information</h4>
<div class="commentary">Did you notice the <tt>https</tt> in all POPVOX page? That means your information is encrypted between your computer and our computers. That protects you even on insecure WiFi networks.</div>
<p>Popvox cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Popvox or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Popvox’s distributors, such as social networks.  Popvox is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>  
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Popvox, at all times.</p>

<h4>Compromise of Personal Information</h4>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Popvox will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h4>Your Choices About Your Information</h4>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Popvox may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and proceeding to your account settings page.   You can review and correct the information about you that Popvox keeps on file by contacting us directly at {% obfuscated_email "privacy@popvox.com" %}.</p>

<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
<div class="commentary">Writing your Members of Congress is a great learning experience. But please have your children under the age of 13 do so through the account of an adult.</div>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Popvox does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Popvox. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at {% obfuscated_email "privacy@popvox.com" %}.</p>

<h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.  Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h4>Notification Procedures</h4>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by Popvox in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
<div class="commentary">The changes we have made to this policy are listed below. When we make future changes that require your approval, we will let you know.</div>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, please contact us at {% obfuscated_email "privacy@popvox.com" %}, or send mail to:</p>

<div class="commentary">Writing your Members of Congress is a great learning experience. But please have your children under the age of 13 do so through the account of an adult.</div>
<p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Popvox, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.  Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.  The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Popvox.</p>
<h5>B. Popvox Accounts</h5>
<div class="commentary">If you register for an organization or as legislative staff, you must be authorized to do so by your organization or office.</div>
<p>You do not need to register for an account to visit Popvox, but registering for a Popvox account gives you access to certain additional functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and at our sole discretion.  We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.  If you open a Popvox account for an organization or congressional legislative staff, or another type of account through which you will represent an organization, company, office for a Member of Congress, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By logging in to Popvox with a third-party sign-in service such as an OAuth provider, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials and private profile information on that service.</p>
<div class="commentary">Since we send messages on your behalf to Congress, we expect you to provide accurate information about yourself.</div>
<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure (or if you use a third-party sign-in, keep your login credentials at the third-party service secure). We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.  You must notify Popvox immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.  Popvox will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<div class="commentary">We&rsquo;re going to email you from time to time if you let us. You can <a href="/accounts/profile">change your email settings here</a>.</div>
<p>By providing Popvox your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail, and updates to this agreement.  We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service, which, you may opt out of in your account settings page.</p>
<h5>C. Service Rules</h5>
