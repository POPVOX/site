		<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
	   
<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on January 20, 2011.</p>
<p>Popvox, Inc. (“Popvox,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Popvox when you use the Popvox Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information.   We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use (see below on this page).</p>  
<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong>  You provide us information about yourself, such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address if you register for an account with the Service. You may also provide us with your public comments on issues, messages to Members of Congress, and messages to other users of the website. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  We may retain any such User-Provided Information indefinitely, except as noted below.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong>  Cookies are small text files that websites store on users’ computers that are used to keep track of who is who, in the same manner that one draws a ticket number at a market or DMV to hold a place in line. Each time you return to a website, your web browser sends back the cookie (i.e. your ticket number) given to you by that website. At Popvox as elsewhere, cookies help you log in faster and enable easier navigation through the site. Popvox uses persistent cookies, meaning they remain indefinitely on users’ computers until the user logs out of their Popvox account or instructs their web browser to clear any saved cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information:</strong>  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,  pages viewed, and other such information. We retain Log File Information for at most one year, after which point we will retain only aggregate statistics based on the Log File Information such as but not limited to site-wide monthly visit totals.</p>
<p><strong>Non-obvious Pingbacks:</strong>  When you use the Service, we may employ pingbacks which may not be obvious to you.  This may occur in HTML-based emails sent to you. The pingback occurs when you read the message if your email application automatically displays remotely stored images embedded in emails, and your email client will automatically report to Popvox the same Log File Information as indicated above. We may also customize the pingback for each recipient so that we know who has read the email.  The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Popvox better for our users.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> On your visit to Popvox your web browser may access resources from third-party services that we have engaged with, including analytics services which help us understand how our users are using the website and advertising services which deliver advertising directly to the user. These services may collect the same sorts of information as described above and their use of it is governed by their Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>  
<p>By providing Popvox your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings.  We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account settings page. You may not opt out of some Service-related e-mails except by closing your Popvox account.</p> 
<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, Popvox may retain your User-Provided Information for a commercially reasonable time as part of our backup and audit procedures.  Furthermore, Popvox may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member account.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation.  Popvox stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at privacy@popvox.com.</p>
<p>We use cookies, non-obvious pingbacks, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) and track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

<h4>How We Share Your Information</h4>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  Popvox may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you.  If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Popvox (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Popvox will not share, rent, or sell your personally identifiable information in any other manner except as stated when you enter the information, or if you opt-in to additional services. For instance, it is noted on the website that Popvox may allow Congressional staff to access your name and physical address if you reside in their Congressional district. Members of Congress are greatly restricted in what they can do with this information by Congressional rules and law. If you use Popvox to comment on legislation before Congress, your comment along with your username and the city and state of your address, as you provided, will be displayed publicly. </h4>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>    
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (“Events”) on the Service together with a third party partner.  If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties’ use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Popvox will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Popvox, our Users or others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for Popvox services.</p>
<p>Popvox may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Popvox. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens and may also use other technologies such as cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  Popvox does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Popvox to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  In addition, third-party advertisers may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you, such as the addresses of the pages you visit. <!--If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here [link to policy and opt-out for relevant advertiser, e.g. http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html for Google or http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp for a number of advertisers including Google].-->  The Popvox Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.  Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p> 

<h4>How We Protect Your Information</h4>
<p>Popvox cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Popvox or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Popvox’s distributors, such as social networks.  Popvox is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>  
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Popvox, at all times.</p>

<h4>Compromise of Personal Information</h4>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Popvox will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h4>Your Choices About Your Information</h4>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Popvox may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and proceeding to your account settings page.   You can review and correct the information about you that Popvox keeps on file by contacting us directly at privacy@popvox.com.</p>

<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Popvox does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Popvox. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@popvox.com.</p>

<h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.  Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h4>Notification Procedures</h4>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by Popvox in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

		<h3>Terms of Use Agreement</h3>

<p>This Agreement was last revised on January 20, 2011.</p>
<p>Popvox.com is the website and online service of Popvox, Inc. (“Popvox,” “we,” or “us”).  This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and mobile services and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”).  By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.</p>  
<p>We reserve the right to amend this Agreement. If we substantively amend this Agreement and you are a registered user, we will give you at least seven (7) days notice before the changes take effect, during which period of time you may reject the changes by terminating your account. No notice shall be required for non-substantive changes to the Agreement. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.  This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>

<h4>1. Use of Our Service</h4>
<h5>A. Eligibility</h5>
<p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Popvox, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.  Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.  The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Popvox.</p>
<h5>B. Popvox Accounts</h5>
<p>You do not need to register for an account to visit Popvox, but registering for a Popvox account gives you access to certain additional functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and at our sole discretion.  We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.  If you open a Popvox account for an organization or congressional legislative staff, or another type of account through which you will represent an organization, company, office for a Member of Congress, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By logging in to Popvox with a third-party sign-in service such as an OAuth provider, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials and private profile information on that service.</p>
<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure (or if you use a third-party sign-in, keep your login credentials at the third-party service secure). We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.  You must notify Popvox immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.  Popvox will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>By providing Popvox your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail, and updates to this agreement.  We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service, which, you may opt out of in your account settings page.</p>
<h5>C. Service Rules</h5>
<p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Popvox servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Popvox grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from Popvox.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other executable code through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any information from the Service, including account names, through which personally identifiable information can be learned; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, misrepresenting your identity; (x) creating multiple accounts; or (xi) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>  
<p>Accessing the audiovisual content available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited.  “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Popvox Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.</p>
<p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service.  We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason.  Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.  </p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Popvox Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.  Popvox shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>
<h4>2. User Content</h4> 
<p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content, such as comments, profile information, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”).  You retain ownership of your User Content.</p>
<p>Except to the extent that User Content expresses support or opposition for a matter on which Popvox is soliciting User opinions, you agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property.

You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy.  Popvox reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Popvox believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p> 
<p>A. Your User Content and Popvox's use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.</p>
<p>B. Popvox may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p>Popvox takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service.  You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.  You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Popvox shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.</p>  
<h4>3. User Content License Grant</h4>
<p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have a right to grant, to Popvox a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service.</p> 
<p>If the features of the Service allow you to remove or delete User Content from the Service, the above licenses granted by you in your User Content terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete such User Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that Popvox may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Content that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Content for which the Service does not provide you a means to delete or remove are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>

<h4>15. General</h4> 
<p><strong>A. Governing Law.</strong>  You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Popvox, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.  This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any claim or dispute between you and Popvox that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California, unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph.</p>  
<p><strong>B. Arbitration.</strong>  For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

Notification Procedures.</strong>  Popvox may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Popvox in our sole discretion. Popvox reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.  Popvox is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.</p>
<p><strong>D. Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong>  This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Popvox in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Popvox concerning the Service.  If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p> 
<p><strong>E. No Waiver.</strong>  No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Popvox’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
