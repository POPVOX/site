			<div class="faq_item" tags="bills, biased, i love POPVOX">
				<a name="billtitles"><h3>Where do the bill titles come from? Some seem so biased.</h3></a>
				
				<p>The titles listed on each bill page are the official titles of the legislation.  The Congressional sponsor of the bill picks the bill's title.  Some official titles are short and sound like a traditional title (i.e., the “Fairness in Taxation Act”) while others are long descriptions of what the bill actually does: "S. 797: A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis ...", (commonly known as the Paycheck Fairness Act.) (link to: https://www.popvox.com/bills/us/112/s797)</p>
	
				<p>Remember the 2010 Tax Cut Extension? Well, officially, it was “the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4853.″ Seriously. (See http://www.popvox.com/blog/2010/12/16/the-tax-cut-extension-or-senate-amendment-to-the-house-amendment-to-the-senate-amendment-to-h-r-4853/)</p>
	
				<p>For confusing, long-winded titles like these, POPVOX may display a popular “street” name for the bill instead. The street name comes either from Congress’s own research team, the Congressional Research Service, or a tag assigned by the POPVOX team based on use in the media or by the public. Our tagging system is still a work in progress, and we will unveil new search tools soon.</p>
