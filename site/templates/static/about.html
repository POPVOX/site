		<h1>About POPVOX.com</h1>
		<h2 class="brackets">POPVOX bridges the gap between the input the public wants to provide and the information Members of Congress want and need to receive.</h2> 
		<p>Constituent communications are flooding and overwhelming Congressional offices. POPVOX verifies, aggregates, and simplifies communication with Congress on an open and trusted (and nonpartisan) common ground.  Advocacy organizations, trade associations, unions and other groups send their members to POPVOX to take action on bills pending before Congress. Congressional staff and lawmakers log into POPVOX to measure the pulse of their district. POPVOX provides a curating interface for anyone &mdash; including Congressional staff, the public and the media &mdash; to access and understand the voice of the people.</p>
