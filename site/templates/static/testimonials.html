				<p class="testimony"><span>&ldquo;</span> I have been using POPVOX since it&rsquo;s inception, and find it to be a very convenient way to let your legislators know exactly how you feel about a bill or issue before Congress. It gives them rapid feedback on the issues, and helps them determine which way to vote. I have found that since using POPVOX, my incoming snail mail from both senators and my representative has increased dramatically. <strong>I feel that I really do have a voice in the halls of Congress.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="testimony"><span>&ldquo;</span> Really like and appreciate the new POPVOX Congress Match. Easy to see where my Senators and Representative are in step with me and where they differ.<strong> I have thoroughly enjoyed POPVOX and the ease at which I can weigh in on bills and know my Senators or Representative receive my input.</strong> Keep up the good work.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="testimony"><span>&ldquo;</span>POPVOX is an innovative way to participate in a virtual public square with the knowledge that you're influencing decision-makers, as well as having fun and engaging fellow political activists. <strong>I also know that when I express my opinion on an issue, my  legislators will receive it in a timely manner, not as a junk mail &ldquo;petition,&rdquo; but as a relevant communication from a verified constituent.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="testimony"><span>&ldquo;</span>Congress and Senators are barraged in social media but donâ€™t easily know who their constituents are -- the people they listen to. Faxes just pile up because there are not enough staffers to handle reading/sorting them efficiently. Instead, I use POPVOX! <strong>It&rsquo;s a fairly new tool that members of Congress ARE paying attention to and that makes it easy for them to see how their region feels.</strong> And, it is user friendly and quick to use for activists.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="testimony"><span>&ldquo;</span>This is a service America NEEDS. The feature that lets you drill down from national to state to district stats is excellent. <strong>The map that is generated summarizing where there is support or opposition for a bill is not only useful, but is beautiful to look at.</strong> I wish more people knew about POPVOX.&rdquo;</p>
