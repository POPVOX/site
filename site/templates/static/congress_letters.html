		<h1>How We Deliver Mail</h1>
		<p class="subhead">Information for legislative correspondents and mail managers in House and Senate member offices.</p>
		
        <p>We have tried to design a system that addresses your needs and the needs of your boss&rsquo; constituents. Constituents want an easy way to make their voices heard; your boss wants to know what people are saying in your state or district and to be able to respond. Having worked in Congressional offices, we know that effective advocacy means not wasting your time.</p>  

        <p>If at any time we can tailor our process to better fit your system, please <a href="/about/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
        
        <h3 class="no_rule">POPVOX Philosophy</h3>
        
        <p>We believe the best constituent mail is both effective and efficient.</p>
        
        <h4>Effective Advocacy</h4>
        
        <ul>
			<li class="ol_1">
				<strong>Asks are actionable.</strong>
				<div>All constituent letters on POPVOX are directed at a particular bill introduced in Congress or a select set of proposals such as draft bill text we believe Congress is considering. Constituents choose to &ldquo;support&rdquo; or &ldquo;oppose&rdquo; the bill or proposal. No constituent letter on POPVOX is ambiguous about what the constituent would like their Member of Congress to do.</div>
			</li>
        
			<li class="ol_2">
				<strong>Letters are personal and informative.</strong>
				<div>The most useful letters are those that tell a personal story &mdash; that is the kind of wisdom constituents are best able to provide through the mail. POPVOX encourages constituents to write personal stories and discourages form letters.</div>
			</li>
        
			<li class="ol_3">
				<strong>The call to action is public.</strong>
				<div>Although not necessarily helpful for Congressional offices, all letters sent via POPVOX are public on POPVOX.com, but anonymous. We believe that a public platform helps constituents drive their issues and creates accountability both for Congress and for advocacy organizations.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 class="clear">Efficient Process</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li class="ol_1">
				<strong>Letters are sortable.</strong>
				<div>As explained below, all letters delivered electronically are tagged in ways to make it faster for legislative correspondents to identify the subject of the message and who sent it.</div>
			</li>
			<li class="ol_2">
				<strong>Delivery is electronic (mostly).</strong>
				<div>The vast majority of letters delivered by POPVOX are delivered electronically. However, we make a commitment to our users to get their messages through. See below for reasons we may bring you constituent mail on paper.</div>
			</li>
			<li class="ol_3">
				<strong>Addressing the right office.</strong>
				<div>Constituent addresses are validated against USPS databases and letters are only delivered to the constituent&rsquo;s own senators and congressman (or delegate). In addition, letters are only delivered to the chamber of Congress in which a bill is up for consideration. When a bill moves to the other chamber letters will automaticlally be delivered to the second chamber.</div>
			</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="no_rule clear">Anatomy of a Message</h3>
        
        <p>We submit constituent mail electronically in the same way as other vendors: by automatically filling out your website&rsquo;s constituent mail form with the information the user gave us. POPVOX has put great care into the details of how each field is entered.</p>
        
        <p>Constituent correspondence software varies somewhat across vendors. As they don&rsquo;t all accept the same fields, you may not see all of these fields in your backend.</p> 
        
        <h4>Standard Fields</h4>
        
        <p>The free-text <strong>subject</strong> field of each letter is filled in with the bill number, the word support or oppose, and the bill title, for example:</p>
        
        <p class="exfield"><strong>Subject:</strong> #hr1234 #oppose H.R. 1234: Example Bill Act.</p>
        
        <p>We add #-marks to the first two words as a hint that these can be found reliably in each POPVOX message. Use this text to search through your mail for all letters on this subject.</p>
        
        <p>There are three parts to the message body:</p>
        
        <p class="exfield"><strong>Message:</strong><br/> 11/29/11. I oppose H.R. 1234: Example Bill Act because the bill would affect my life in particular ways that I am writing to you about here.<br/>
-----<br/>
sent via popvox.com; ...@popvox.com; see http://www.popvox.com/bills/us/112/hr1234/report</p>

		<p>The message begins with the <strong>date</strong> the letter was written. This is typically within the few days before you received it. However, because we deliver mail initially only to the chamber of Congress in which the bill is pending a vote, when a bill moves from the House to the Senate, or vice versa, we will send letters automatically to the second chamber. That means that you will occasionally see letters written substantially earlier. We hold mail in this way to avoid burdening your office with constituent sentiment on issues that your office cannot act on. (You can, however, find the letters on POPVOX.com)</p>
		
		<p>Following the date is the <strong>constituent-written letter</strong>. While we start the constituent off with a few suggested words based on whether the constituent chose to support or oppose the bill (such as &ldquo;I oppose H.R. 1234: Example Bill Act because&rdquo;), we do not provide any other pre-written text.</p>
		
		<p>A standard <strong>delivery footer</strong> comes at the end of each message to indicate that POPVOX was responsible for the delivery of the message. It includes our contact email address in case there are any problems with the delivery and a link to POPVOX for more information about the issue. You can also <strong>use the link</strong> to search for other messages on the same subject.</p>
		
		<p class="exfield"><strong>Reply Choice:</strong> Response Requested</p>
		
		<p>For most messages, if your webform asks the constituent whether they want a response, we fill it in in the affirmative. However, see below for when we fill it in in the negative.</p>
		
		<h4>Non-standard Metadata</h4>
		
		<p>Some webforms have hidden fields meant for delivery agents such as POPVOX that are used to submit additional details about the message. These fields will appear in your mail backend program if your system supports it. We fill out these fields when they are present on the webform.</p>
		
		<p>We fill out the <b>campaign info</b> and <b>campaign ID</b> fields with text can be used to search for other letters on the same issue. Note that while the CampaignID is a web address (a URL) for convenience, so that you can visit the address to see what the letter is about, you may still consider using it as a search term to find other letters on the same issue.</p>
		
		<p class="exfield"><strong>CampaignInfo:</strong> Comments Opposing H.R. 1234: Example Bill Act</p>
		<p class="exfield"><strong>CampaignID:</strong> http://popvox.com/bills/us/112/hr1234#oppose</p>
		
		<p>When a message is submitted via one of our widgets placed on the website of an advocacy organization, we indicate the organization hosting the widget in the <strong>organization</strong> metadata field. If the letter was submitted on POPVOX.com directly, this field is left blank. When there is an organization, we also fill out the <strong>campaign info</b> and <b>campaign ID</b> fields slightly differently:</p>
		
		<p class="exfield"><strong>Organization:</strong> Bald Eagle Example Association</p>
		<p class="exfield"><strong>CampaignInfo:</strong> Stop Example Bills</p>
		<p class="exfield"><strong>CampaignID:</strong> http://popvox.com/orgs/baldeaglesexampleassoc</p>
		
		<p>Finally, we use the <strong>delivery agent</strong> and <strong>delivery agent contact</strong> fields to help you identify that POPVOX submitted the letter and to help you contact us with any concerns. We actually include the cell phone number of our chief technology officer in the delivery agent contact field.</p>
		
		<p class="exfield"><strong>DeliveryAgent:</strong> POPVOX.com</p>
		<p class="exfield"><strong>DeliveryAgentContact:</strong> Josh Tauberer, CTO, POPVOX.com -- ...@popvox.com -- cell: ...-...-....</p>
		
		<h4>Empty Letters</h4>
		
		<p>It may seem counterintuitive at first, but we give our users <strong>the choice to not write a message</strong> at all, and this is actually beneficial to you. Each user must choose whether they support or oppose the bill, but they can send a letter to you with one click if they choose not to write a personal message.</p>
		
		<p>Why do we deliver mail that took the constituent virtually no effort to send? We have heard from many offices that they prefer to get this mail because then they have the opportunity to respond if they choose, and they will have more information about how their constituents feel if they choose to use it. (POPVOX does not tell its users that your office will respond. That is up to you.) But by asking the user up-front whether they would like to write a personal message, we are able to mark the letters without messages in a way that you know <strong>how much effort</strong> was put into sending them. Some offices have a policy of putting in an effort to respond that is proportional to the effort the constituent took to write in, and we hope that this makes those choices easier to make.</p>
		
		<p>You can identify these messages in two ways. First, the message body is different:</p>
		
		<p class="exfield"><strong>Message:</strong><br/>
		11/29/11. Oppose H.R. 1234: Example Bill Act.<br/>
		<br/>
		[This constituent weighed in at POPVOX.com but chose not to leave a personal comment and is not expecting a response. See http://www.popvox.com/bills/us/112/hr1234/report. Contact ...@popvox.com with delivery concerns.]
		</p>
		
		<p>The single sentence expressing the constituent&rsquo;s view is written by POPVOX and appears uniformly this way in these sorts of messages. (If your webform accepts a free-text subject field, you will also see the same information there, as described above.)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>footer</strong> of the message is also revised to indicate why there is no actual letter.</p>
		
		<p>Secondly, for these messages we mark that the constituent does not expect a reply. The constituent is aware that he or she has written a letter to you but does not hold an expectation of receiving a reply. Thus you will see something like this:</p>

		<p class="exfield"><strong>Reply Choice:</strong> No Response Necessary</p>
		
		<h3 class="no_rule clear">Why We Sometimes Print Mail</h3>
		
		<p>We send over 95% of constituent mail in electronically using webforms. There are several reasons why we might send you a printed letter, such as if your webform...</p>
		
		<ul class="bullets">
		<li>uses Javascript in an unusual way</li>
		<li>has an unusual CAPTCHA</li>
		<li>doesn’t provide a confirmation page of a sucessful form submission</li>
		<li>has subscribe/unsubscribe options for your mail list but no “no change” option</li>
		<li>reports “technical difficulties” all the time</li>
		<li>rejects legitimate ZIP+4s / legitimate street addresses in your district</li>
		<li>requires extra address info (e.g. county) and we couldn’t verify the user’s address</li>
		</ul>
		
        <p class="clear">In any of these cases we can alternatively send you a spreadsheet document electronically of the same information. Please <a href="/about/contact">contact us</a> for details about that.</p>
        
        <h3 class="no_rule clear">The Future of Correspondence Technology</h3>
        
        <p>Our goal is to apply technology to constituent correspondence processes. We have an eye on the future of constituent correspondence technology and are working with the Congressional Management Foundation and the House HIR office on new strategies for message delivery.</p>
