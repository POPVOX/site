POPVOX System Stack
===================

This file documents all components of our live system stack, including any
external service that affects any deployed services (POPVOX.com, iPad, etc.).

Google Apps (g.popvox.com)
--------------------------

	Google Apps is at the top of the stack because most other services are
	tied to email accounts, which means a compromised email account could
	compromise the whole stack.
	
	Admin accounts:
	
		josh, annalee
	
	Settings:
	
		The option to send an admin password reset to the outside address
		is disabled.
	
		"Enable SSL" is on for the domain.
	
		"Two-step verification" is enabled first for the domain (let's user
		choose option) and then enabled for the admins for Google Apps.
			
			additionally, josh has stored a one-time backup verification code
			for two-step verification in the ICJIM file.
			
			Two-step verification sends a code to a cell phone to grant login
			from a new computer. Thus, if a cell phone number changes, this
			configuration must be updated.
			
				josh:    his cell phone
				annalee: her google voice account
			
		*Even with two-step verification, the question is: who can read email
		to an account that is used for the registration of another service?*
	
	We've agreed to provide mail forwarding for a year (until
	the end of August 2011) for David Troy:
	  dave@popvox.com -> davetroy@gmail.com
	  jennifer@popvox.com -> jtroy@roundhousetech.com (updated from jennifer.troy1@gmail.com on 8/19/10)


Network Solutions
-----------------
	
	The login information is stored in the ICJIM file.
	
		email: domain.contact@popvox.com
		           --- should not be easily readable to avoid hijacking by grabbing a password reset,
		           --- but right now just forwards to josh
		secondary email: an off-site email address that josh has that would be hard to guess
